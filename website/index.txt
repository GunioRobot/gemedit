h1. Gem Editor

h1. 'gemedit'


h2. What

Gemedit lets you quickly open up the source for a gem in your favorite editor.

Looking through other people's code is a great way to learn.  I often use it when a gem's RDoc isn't as helpful as I'd like or just want to see how someone put a library together.  Gemedit just makes it easier to get to the code.

h2. Installing

<pre><code>$ sudo gem install gemedit</code></pre>

h2. Demonstration of usage

If you want to see how gemedit works just install it and run this:
  <pre><code>$ gem edit gemedit</code></pre>

Gemedit tries to use your favorite editor from your @$GEMEDITOR@, @$VISUAL@ or @$EDITOR@ environment variable.  It will fall back to _everyone's_ favorite editor: *vi*.  You can specify the editor with the @-e/--editor@ switch.  Run this to view the source for @rake@ in "TextMate":http://macromates.com:
  <pre><code>$ gem edit -e mate rake</code></pre>

And of course, help is available:
  <pre><code>$ gem edit -h</code></pre>
  <pre><code>$ gem edit --help</code></pre>
